# Cheating

Sapiens contains a few tools to cheat, built automatically into the game. It is unknown if dave will remove these before launch!

:::warning
In latest betas, these cheat tools are not available without modifying the game. Check `gameConstants.lua`.

## Debug Menu

To access to the debug menu, you can select it from the settings tab:

It is suggested that you enabled the debug display checkbox, which will enable two additional displays:

### Debug Display

The debug display shows in the top right corner of your screen, and is similar to the `f3` tab in games like Minecraft. It will show your FPS, currently queued order totals, among other things.

### Context Aware Debugging

The context aware debugger is an odd little "debug" button that will appear in the bottom left corner of your screen. It will allow you to perform a single "debug" action on the currently selected object.

`note:` The debug button mostly won't do anything. Only specific contexts have any functionality.

## Lua Console

The Lua console can be summoned by pressing `c` to summon the chat window, then typing `/lua` to enter lua mode. This mode essentially allows you to execute lua code, although it does not store state between commands.

How to open console:

### Set Sun

- Description: Sets the sun to sunrise.

- Format: `setSunset()`

### Teleport
